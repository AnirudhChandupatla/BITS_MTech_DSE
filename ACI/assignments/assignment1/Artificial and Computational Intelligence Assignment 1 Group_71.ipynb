    "\n",
    "Performance Measure- The performance efficiency and effectiveness of the robot is measured on the basis of the ability to find the optimal path from the start position to the finish position, termed as ‘Goal’, while avoiding and minimizing the encounter with obstacles such as the Fire, bush and walls. The robot should be able to complete its task in a timely and efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment- The environment of the rescue robot is the cave represented as a maze. The cave contains obstacles such as walls, bush and the fire. The task of the robot is to move through the maze from the starting point till the end point, that is the goal, and rescue the rabbit from the cave. While trying to navigate through the cave, the robot must find the optimal path, avoiding any penalties awarded for crossing the bush and the fire and at least a number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Data Structure choosen to represent environment is Matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "Actuators- The actuators of the robot that rescues the rabbit are its movement capabilities. The robot can move in four directions, North, South, East and West. It uses these movements to navigate through the cave and find the optimal path to the finish position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensors- The rescue robot has sensors that allows it to perceive the environment around it and helps it more in legal directions. The robot can use its sensors to detect obstacles such as the walls and penalty imposing cells of bush and fire. The sensor also allows the robot to determine its present position and helps it in moving towards the goal position.\n"
